# A collection of configuration files for the deployment of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

All files can be imported to Microsoft Intune using the community tool provided by @Micke-K - https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement

All files uploaded have been tested in my own dev environment, you should always test thoroughly in your own test environment before deploying to production.
